plugin.video.telkkarista_com
----------------------------

This is a kodi.tv plugin to access telkkarista.com. This plugin is made with the idea that that i just want to sharpen my Python skills. There is already another plugin doing exactly what mine is also doing (see link in links section). That plugin is based on old tvkaista.fi plugin and codebase is rather old and not so clean in my eyes. 

So bare with me :)
